EINF
====

EINF is a revised Android image that includes a Android sensing stack for 
energy-efficient context inference using heterogenerous cores. It is 
described in

    Chenguang Shen, Supriyo Chakraborty, Kasturi Rangan Raghavan, Haksoo Choi, Mani B Srivastava, 
    "Exploiting Processor Heterogeneity For Energy Efficient Context Inference On Mobile Phones," 
    5th Workshop on Power-Aware Computing and Systems (HotPower'13) 

EINF is an ongoing work. Instructions for building & flashing on device will come soon.
